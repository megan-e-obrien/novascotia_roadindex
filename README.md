9,544 km2 have a road density less than or equal to 0.6, considered the threshold value above which certain large vertebrates decline (Foreman and Hersperger, 1996). This represents 17.3% of the calculated land area. 82.7% of land in the province thus has a road density considered harmful to certain species' distribution.
